📖 Study Strategy:
------------------

Week Before Interview:
Day 1-2: C# Basics + JavaScript Basics (required for role)
Day 3-4: Interview Crash Course + coding practice  
Day 5: Study Guides 1 & 2 (comprehensive)
Day 6: GUI Interview Guide + system design
Day 7: Review weak areas + mock interviews

Day Before:
- Review Interview Crash Course
- Practice 5-10 LeetCode problems
- Prepare resume stories
- Review questions to ask

🎓 Your Advantages:
-------------------
✅ 4+ years backend experience
✅ Python, FastAPI, Flask expertise → Similar to C#
✅ GCP, AWS, Docker skills → DevOps ready
✅ ETL pipelines → Complex system experience
✅ Testing with pytest → Quality focus
✅ CI/CD and monitoring → Production-ready

🔑 Talking Points:
------------------
- Connect Dataflow pipeline work to medical device data streams
- Emphasize quick learning (mastered FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- Highlight production monitoring (DataDog/Rollbar) for reliability
- Show full-stack thinking (Real Estate Website project)
- Demonstrate quality focus (pytest, code reviews)

💬 Questions to Ask:
--------------------
1. What's the current GUI technology stack and roadmap?
2. How do you handle regulatory compliance in development?
3. What's the onboarding process for learning C# and Electron?
4. How do you balance maintenance vs new features?
5. What testing practices are in place for medical devices?

✨ Special Features:
--------------------
- All code examples include time/space complexity
- Real-world problem solutions (sensor monitoring, log parsing, validation)
- Medical device context throughout
- Connects your resume experience to interview answers
- Syntax comparisons help leverage Python knowledge

📊 Content Statistics:
----------------------
Total Pages: 8 HTML files + 1 index
Code Examples: 100+ across all pages
Topics Covered: 50+ technical concepts
Practice Problems: 15+ with solutions
Comparison Tables: 10+ (Python/C#/JS/Java)

🎯 Success Tips:
----------------
✓ You already know the concepts - just learn new syntax
✓ Emphasize learning ability over current C# knowledge
✓ Show how your backend experience translates to GUI work
✓ Medical devices need reliability - highlight your monitoring experience
✓ Be enthusiastic about learning new technologies

📱 After Deployment:
--------------------
Your site URL will be: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/interview-study-guide/

You can:
- Access from any device (phone, tablet, laptop)
- Bookmark for quick reference
- Study offline (browser caches pages)
- Share with friends or mentors
- Update by pushing new commits

🍀 Good Luck!
-------------
You've got this! Your strong foundation in Python, APIs, and production systems
gives you everything you need to succeed. The C# and JavaScript syntax will come
quickly - you're already a skilled software engineer.

Remember: They're hiring for problem-solving ability and learning potential,
not just existing C# expertise.
